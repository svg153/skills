# Pitch Research Synthesis Protocol

**Contents:** Before Writing · Cross-Source Connections to Look For · Confidence Rating · Pitch Construction Process · Output File Templates (pitch-full, pitch-5min, pitch-2min, pitch-1min, pitch-email, pitch-appendix, pitch-deck-outline, pitch-scorecard) · Post-Synthesis Verification

## Before Writing

1. Read ALL raw files in `{project-name}/raw/` before writing anything
2. Read ALL prior session files (from startup-design, startup-competitors, startup-positioning) if they exist
3. Identify the strongest pitch elements — what's most impressive about this company?
4. Determine the optimal pitch order based on strengths
5. Check if the pitch was built with or without validated research data — this affects the scorecard

## Cross-Source Connections to Look For

These are pitch-specific patterns that emerge when you combine research with founder data:

- **Strong traction + weak insight = lead with traction** — the numbers speak for themselves
- **Weak traction + strong insight = lead with insight** — reframe the conversation around the thesis
- **Strong team + emerging market = lead with team** — investors bet on people in uncertain markets
- **Large market + clear model = lead with opportunity** — the math is compelling
- **Comparable success story + similar approach = use the analogy** — investors love pattern-matching
- **Investor fatigue in space + unique angle = differentiate the narrative** — show you're different
- **Strong "why now" + weak traction = lead with timing** — the wave is more impressive than the surfer
- **Competitive gaps + unique attributes = frame against competitors** — show the opening

## Confidence Rating

Apply to every major claim in the pitch materials:

- **High:** Multiple sources agree, data is recent, verifiable
- **Medium:** Some evidence but gaps, or data partially disagree
- **Low:** Limited data, mostly inferred, or data older than 12 months

In the pitch itself, only use High and Medium confidence claims. Low confidence items go in the appendix as "areas to strengthen."

## Pitch Construction Process

### Step 1: Identify Pitch DNA

Before writing anything, answer these questions:

1. **What's the single most impressive thing about this company?** (This determines pitch order)
2. **What's the 2-sentence description?** (This is non-negotiable — must be crystal clear)
3. **What's the unique insight?** (This separates a pitch from a product description)
4. **What's the "why now"?** (Timing thesis — what makes this moment right)
5. **What's the biggest weakness?** (Must have a prepared answer)

### Step 2: Assemble the Building Blocks

Map available data to the 8 pitch elements:

| Element | Source | Strength | Notes |
|---------|--------|----------|-------|
| What You Do | Intake / positioning-statement.md | | |
| Traction | Intake / scorecard.md | | |
| Unique Insight | Intake / research | | |
| Business Model | lean-canvas.md / revenue-model.md | | |
| Market Size | market-analysis.md / intake | | |
| Team | Intake | | |
| The Ask | Intake | | |
| Why Now | Wave 2 research / intake | | |

Strength ratings: Strong / Adequate / Weak / Missing

**Data Foundation Check:** Note whether each element is backed by validated research (from prior startup skills) or self-reported data (from intake only). This affects the scorecard in Phase 4.

### Step 3: Determine Pitch Order

Based on element strengths, select the template from `pitch-frameworks.md`:
- Strongest element is Traction → Traction-Led
- Strongest element is Team → Team-Led
- Strongest element is Insight → Insight-Led
- No clear standout → Pre-Traction (default)

### Step 4: Write the Narrative

Construct the pitch as a continuous story, not a collection of sections. Each element should flow naturally into the next. The narrative should feel like:

"Here's what we do. [Here's why it's working / Here's what we know / Here's who we are.] Here's the problem we're solving. Here's our solution. Here's how big this can get. Here's how we make money. Here's why we're the team to do it. Here's what we need."

### Step 5: Generate All Requested Formats

From the full narrative, derive each format by compression — not by rewriting from scratch. Each shorter format is a subset of the full pitch.

> **Speaker notes:** {delivery guidance}
> **Timing:** 2:00 - 3:00

### Solution
{How it works — describe the concrete user experience. What does the user SEE and DO? Not abstract features — the specific interaction that solves the problem. If the product exists, describe it as if showing a demo. If pre-launch, describe the intended experience vividly enough that the investor can picture it.}

> **Speaker notes:** {delivery guidance}
> **Timing:** 3:00 - 4:00

### Traction
{Metrics with timeframes — growth story. If no traction: skip this section, don't fake it.}

### The Ask
{Amount + milestones + timeframe. Be direct and confident.}

> **Speaker notes:** {delivery guidance}

## Top 10 Investor Questions (with Prepared Answers)

### Q1: {Most likely question}
**Short answer:** {2-3 sentences — for verbal delivery}
**Detailed answer:** {full explanation with data — for follow-up emails}
**Source:** {where the data comes from}

[Repeat for Q2-Q10]

## Objection Handling

### "{Objection 1}"
**Why they ask this:** {investor's concern}
**Response:** {how to address it honestly}
**Supporting data:** {evidence}

[Repeat for each common objection]

## Known Weaknesses
{Honest assessment of pitch gaps — with plans to address each. Identifying weaknesses proactively is stronger than hoping investors won't notice.}

## Financial Backup
{Detailed numbers if available from prior sessions. If not: note "Financial projections not yet validated — consider running startup-design for detailed modeling."}

## Competitive Detail
{Deeper competitive analysis for Q&A — from prior sessions if available. If not: note "Competitive landscape not fully mapped — consider running startup-competitors for battle cards."}

## Red Flags
- {appendix-specific concerns}

## Yellow Flags
- {areas needing more data}

## Data Gaps & Limitations
- {what data is missing — every pitch has blind spots, be explicit}

## Sources
- {all data sources used across all deliverables, with tier ratings}
```

## Post-Synthesis Verification

After writing all pitch deliverables (before the scorecard/review phase), run the Verification Agent protocol. See `references/verification-agent.md` for the full process. The verification step checks all deliverables for unlabeled claims, internal contradictions, confidence rating consistency, and startup-pitch-specific coherence (pitch claims vs. source data, cross-format consistency, pitch vs. appendix alignment, honesty checks).

### pitch-deck-outline.md

Translate the full narrative into slides — compression and visualization, not new writing. Follow the pitch order already established; a typical investor deck runs 10-12 slides (Title, Problem, Solution, Market, Product, Business Model, Traction, Go-to-Market, Team, Financials, The Ask).

```markdown
# Pitch Deck Outline: {product}
*Skill: startup-pitch | Generated: {date}*

**Source narrative:** pitch-full.md — same order, translated to slides.

## Slide 1 — Title
**Headline:** {Company name + one-line description in customer language}
**Visual:** Logo, tagline
**Speaker notes:** {The 2-sentence opener}

## Slide {N} — {Element}
**Headline:** {One takeaway sentence — never a label}
**Body:**
- {3-5 bullets, under 30 words total}
**Visual:** {Chart / diagram / screenshot suggestion}
**Speaker notes:** {What to say, from the corresponding pitch-full.md section}

{...repeat for all slides...}

## Deck Quality Checklist
- [ ] Every headline tells the takeaway (headlines alone, in sequence, pitch the company)
- [ ] One idea per slide
- [ ] Under 30 words per slide body
- [ ] A visual suggested for every slide
- [ ] Speaker notes on every slide
- [ ] The final slide carries a clear ask

## Red Flags

### pitch-scorecard.md

```markdown
# Pitch Scorecard: {product}
*Skill: startup-pitch | Generated: {date}*

## Data Foundation
**Built with:** {Validated research (startup-design/competitors/positioning) / Self-reported data (intake only)}
{If self-reported: "Note: This pitch was built without validated research data. Scores in Market Sizing, Traction Honesty, and competitive Q&A may improve significantly after running startup-design or startup-competitors."}

## Scoring Rubric

| Dimension | Score (1-10) | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Clarity** | | {Can someone explain what you do after hearing 2 sentences?} |
| **Strength Sequencing** | | {Is the most impressive element in the first 60 seconds?} |
| **Traction Honesty** | | {Are numbers accurate, timeframed, and real? Or acknowledged as missing?} |
| **Insight Quality** | | {Is the insight genuinely non-obvious and specific?} |
| **Market Sizing** | | {Is the math bottom-up with clear assumptions?} |
| **Business Model** | | {One model, clearly stated?} |
| **Team Credentials** | | {Specific, verifiable accomplishments?} |
| **Ask Clarity** | | {Amount + milestones + timeframe, stated with confidence?} |
| **Overall** | | |

## Verdict
- **65-80:** Investor-ready. Go pitch.
- **50-64:** Investor-ready with caveats. Address the weak dimensions first.
- **35-49:** Needs work. Iterate on the weakest areas before pitching.
- **Below 35:** Major gaps. Consider running startup-design or startup-positioning to strengthen the foundation.

## Weak Dimensions (Score < 7)
For each:
- **Dimension:** {name}
- **What's weak:** {specific problem}
- **How to fix:** {actionable suggestion}
- **Data needed:** {what information would strengthen this}

## Delivery Readiness
